============

RaspberryPi gaming glory: Software to run a 38x76 single-colour LED matrix/display and some basic, classic games. This project will be divided up into 2 software sections:
- High-level programming: will include games (starting with Pong!) and other things in the future.
- Low-level programming: writing a library that will provide the key functions + hardware interface
